# Auto-Rickshaw Waiting Time Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes passenger waiting times for auto-rickshaws in a semi-urban area using self-collected observational data.

## Data
Primary data was collected through real-world observation across different routes and time slots.
The dataset includes route, time slot, and waiting time (minutes).

## Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Route-wise and time-slot-wise comparison
- Visualization of waiting time patterns

## Demo Model
A simple linear regression model is included to demonstrate the machine learning workflow.
Due to the small dataset size, the model is implemented strictly for learning purposes.

## Key Findings
- Average waiting time is approximately 19 minutes with high variability.
- The B–A route experiences higher and inconsistent waiting times.
- Evening time slots show peak congestion.

## Limitations
This project is based on a small, self-collected dataset and focuses on exploratory insights.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
